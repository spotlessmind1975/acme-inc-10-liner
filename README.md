Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size, the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category: **EXTREME-256**) and it does not rely on third party libraries. Moreover, since it uses specific features of each home computer, there is a specific ugBASIC source for each one. The check on constraints has been done using [UGBASIC-IDE](https://spotlessmind1975.itch.io/ugbasic-ide).
